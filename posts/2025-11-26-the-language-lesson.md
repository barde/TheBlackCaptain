description: Stranded at port waiting for his transit ship, the Captain encounters Austrian-Hungarian navy soldiers seeking the tongue of their enemies, and shares an ancient method of learning languages at sea
---

The Captain found himself in one of those liminal spaces that maritime life provides in abundance - waiting at a small port for his transit ship, which would carry him to the harbor where his own vessel lay anchored. The weather had turned foul, cancellations rippled through the schedules like waves across a pond, and the local establishment where he sought refuge offered grog of a quality that could only be described as "adequate for survival but not for pleasure."

He had settled into the corner of the port tavern, nursing his disappointing drink and watching the door, when it burst open to admit three figures in the unmistakable uniforms of the [Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Navy) - the Imperial and Royal Navy of Austria-Hungary. A force to be reckoned with, the Captain knew, though their sailors were not often seen in these northern waters.

## The Navy's Finest

The trio made an impression. First came a Master Gunner, a barrel-chested man whose hands bore powder burns that spoke of countless engagements. Behind him strode a Surgeon, lean and precise in his movements, still wearing his operating apron though it had been hastily cleaned. And last - the Captain noticed with interest - a Navigator, a woman whose sharp eyes swept the room with the practiced assessment of one who charts courses through dangerous straits.

They were not exhausted, despite what their disheveled appearance might suggest. No, these were souls running hot after recent action, their blood still carrying the electricity of battle. From fragments of their loud conversation, the Captain gathered they had been in some engagement - not against his fellow merchants of opportunity, but against the Dutch. The [K.u.K. Marine](https://austria-forum.org/af/Wissenssammlungen/Biographien/Bedeutende_österreichische_Frauen/Kriegsmarine) had been asserting itself in contested waters again.

What caught the Captain's attention, however, was not their war stories but what sat upon their table: an assortment of the finest black rum the Captain had seen in many months. Bottles with labels from the Caribbean, from the Indies, from ports whose names alone could make a sailor's mouth water. This was proper treasure, claimed no doubt from some prize vessel.

And what were they doing with this treasure? Ignoring it, the Captain observed with growing consternation. They were too busy complaining.

"We cannot understand a word those *verdammte* Dutchmen say," the Master Gunner was grumbling. "How can you fight an enemy whose signals you cannot read?"

"If we knew their tongue," the Navigator agreed, her accent carrying the lilt of the Adriatic, "we could intercept their communications. Plan our approaches. Perhaps even..." she smiled, "convince them to surrender before a shot is fired."

The Surgeon nodded thoughtfully. "A victory without bloodshed is the surgeon's favorite kind."

## The Captain's Approach

Now, the Captain was not typically one to approach strangers, particularly strangers in the uniform of a navy that viewed his kind of commerce with some disapproval. But the grog in his cup was truly terrible, and that rum was truly magnificent, and a man stranded at port grows bold - or perhaps simply desperate.

He rose and approached their table with a confidence that surprised even himself.

"Good evening, fellow seamen and -woman," he said, removing his woolen hat in greeting. "The Captain could not help but overhear your predicament. You wish to learn the language of your enemies, yes?"

The Master Gunner's hand moved toward his holster. The Navigator's eyes narrowed. But the Surgeon - a man trained to read bodies and their intentions - held up a staying hand.

"And what would a merchant sailor know of such things?" he asked, though his tone carried curiosity rather than dismissal.

The Captain smiled. "The Captain has learned the languages of many nations in his years upon the seas. And he learned them without benefit of any electrical device - no speaking boxes, no glowing screens, no demanding green owls that screech when you forget your lessons."

Despite themselves, the naval officers laughed. They had all, it seemed, encountered that particular pedagogical bird.

## The Grandmother's Method

"Sit, merchant," the Navigator said, kicking out a chair. "Tell us your method. We have weeks at sea ahead of us, and nothing but time."

The Captain sat, and as he did, the Surgeon pushed one of the precious rum bottles toward him. A fair trade was being proposed.

"The Captain's grandmother was a woman of many skills," he began, pouring himself a measure of the dark spirit. "Each morning upon waking, and each night before sleep, she would read to the young Captain from the [Book of Psalms](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201&version=KJV). Not as mere devotion, though it was that too, but as training."

"Training for what?" the Master Gunner asked.

"Memory," the Captain replied. "She made the boy memorize those Psalms, verse by verse, chapter by chapter. At the time, he resented it - what child wishes to spend his mornings reciting ancient Hebrew poetry translated into his mother tongue? But she was building something in his mind. A capacity."

He took a sip of the rum. It was extraordinary - smooth yet complex, carrying notes of molasses and distant spices.

"When the Captain later wished to learn Dutch, or French, or Portuguese, he already possessed texts he knew by heart in his own language. The Psalms. The same words, the same poetry, translated into every tongue on Earth."

The Navigator leaned forward, understanding dawning in her eyes. "So you would find a Bible in the new language..."

"Precisely. The Captain would wander in disguise into their churches, pray submissively to our Lord and Saviour, and very often - " he chuckled at the memory " - the local priests would gift him a Bible simply for his devotion in staying for hours at their services."

"But why the Psalms specifically?" the Surgeon pressed, his analytical mind engaged.

"Because they are difficult," the Captain answered. "They are poetry. They twist and turn, they use metaphor and repetition, they express emotions that require nuance. If you can understand the Psalms in a new language, you can understand anything. If you can *feel* them - the rage of Psalm 137, the peace of Psalm 23, the wonder of Psalm 19 - then you have not merely learned a language. You have begun to think in it."

## The Surgeon's Insight

The Surgeon was nodding vigorously now. "Yes! Yes, this is precisely correct. When you memorize difficult texts, when you truly commit them to memory, you create..." he searched for the word, "pathways. The brain builds [roads that can carry new traffic](/treasure-trove/memory-techniques.html)."

"You have studied this?" the Captain asked with genuine interest.

"I have read of an Italian philosopher who wrote extensively on the art of memory," the Surgeon replied. "Giordano Bruno. A heretic, they called him, and burned him for it. But his techniques for expanding the mind's capacity..." he shook his head admiringly. "The Church feared what they could not understand."

"The Captain has heard of this Bruno," he said. "A man who built palaces in his mind and walked through them to remember whatever he wished."

"So we should sit on the head every morning and memorize Psalms in Dutch?" the Master Gunner asked, his practicality cutting through the philosophy.

The Navigator elbowed him. "He means while *on* the head. The privy."

"Where else does a sailor have privacy for such pursuits?" the Captain shrugged. "The Captain has memorized more scripture in such locations than in any church. The important thing is consistency. Every day, the same time, even a few verses. Within weeks, you will find Dutch sentences forming in your mind unbidden. Within months, you will dream in it."

## The Exchange

The naval officers exchanged glances. Something had shifted - the merchant sailor had proven himself valuable, and among seafaring folk, value must be recognized.

"For this wisdom," the Navigator said formally, "the Imperial and Royal Navy offers its thanks." She pushed two more bottles across the table. "And its finest captured rum."

The Captain accepted graciously. "The Captain would also recommend, for those who wish to delve deeper into the art of memory itself, seeking out Bruno's work. It is dense, it is difficult, but for minds sharp enough to navigate contested waters and chart courses through fog..." he raised his glass to the Navigator, "it will yield treasures beyond measure."

They drank together then, enemies of circumstance become companions of the moment, united by the universal sailor's love of knowledge, rum, and the promise of victory achieved through wisdom rather than bloodshed.

## The Departure

When the Captain's transit ship was finally called - hours later, after the weather had grudgingly improved - he left the tavern carrying three bottles of exceptional black rum and something lighter still: the satisfaction of knowledge shared.

The Surgeon had pressed a scrap of paper into his hand as they parted. On it was written a name: *De Umbris Idearum*. "Bruno's masterwork," he had explained. "If you can find a translation, it will show you chambers of memory you never knew your mind contained."

The Captain tucked the paper into his coat pocket, next to his Bible - a small, worn volume in his mother tongue, its Psalms so familiar he could recite them in the dark, which had opened doors to a dozen languages across thirty years of sailing.

His grandmother, he thought as the transit ship pulled away from the dock, would have approved. She had always said that the Word of God was a key that could open any lock. The Captain had simply discovered that the locks it opened included not just the gates of heaven, but the gates of foreign tongues, foreign ports, and the foreign minds of enemies who might yet become friends.

The K.u.K. officers waved from the dock, already arguing about who would memorize which Psalm first. The Captain raised his bottle in salute and turned toward the horizon, where his own ship waited, and where new languages and new adventures surely lay ahead.
