# The Drunken Scholars

The Black Captain knew the type the moment they appeared at the dock.

Two young men, perhaps twenty-three or twenty-four years old, approached with the careful walk of people trying very hard to appear casual. They wore workers' clothes - clean workers' clothes, which was the first mistake. Their hands were soft, which was the second. And when they spoke, they used the grammar of educated men trying to sound uneducated, which was the third and most obvious mistake of all.

"We're looking for work, Captain," said the taller one, a lean fellow with intelligent eyes that darted everywhere. "Heard your ship might need hands."

"Cleaning work," added the shorter one quickly. He had the build of someone who spent more time with books than ropes. "We're good with cleaning."

The Captain studied them without speaking. Behind him, the crew went about their tasks with the practiced efficiency of men who had worked together for years. The ship creaked gently at her moorings, and gulls called overhead.

"Cleaning work," the Captain repeated. "On a ship."

"Yes, sir," said the tall one. "We're hard workers."

"And honest," added the short one.

The Captain almost smiled at that. Honest men don't usually feel the need to announce it.

## The Ruse

The truth was obvious to anyone with eyes. These were nobles - or at least from wealthy merchant families - out for adventure. Probably fled some arranged marriage, or bored with their studies, or running from debts of honor that their fathers would pay but they couldn't bear to accept.

The Captain had seen it before. Young men of privilege who romanticized life at sea, imagining adventure and freedom, not understanding that a ship is just another kind of cage - smaller than most, and with worse food.

They would last perhaps two weeks before crawling back to whatever comfortable life they'd abandoned, sunburned and seasick and grateful for feather beds.

But.

But there was something in their eyes. Not just the bright eagerness of youth seeking excitement. Something sharper. A cleverness that might be useful, if properly directed.

"You know anything about cleaning?" the Captain asked.

"Everything," said the tall one, too quickly.

"We're very thorough," said the short one.

"And the pay?"

"We'll work for passage," the tall one said. "And... meals."

"And drink," added the short one.

There it was. The Captain noted the way they glanced at each other when drink was mentioned. This wasn't just about adventure. This was about escape from something that made even cheap ship's rum seem preferable to whatever waited for them on land.

"You have names?"

The tall one hesitated. "Does it matter?"

"It does on a ship," the Captain said.

They gave names - probably not their real ones, but names serve their purpose whether true or false.

"Alright," the Captain said. "You can have your cleaning work. But on a ship, everyone does what needs doing. Understood?"

"Yes, Captain!"

They were trying so hard.

## The First Week

The Captain had been right about several things and wrong about one important detail.

Right: They knew nothing about ships.

Right: Their hands blistered within days.

Right: They were running from something.

Wrong: They were not useless.

The two young men attacked their cleaning duties with the determined focus of men who had spent years studying difficult subjects and passing examinations. They learned quickly - too quickly to be ordinary workers, which confirmed the Captain's suspicions - and they worked with surprising efficiency.

They were tidy. Obsessively so. The sections they cleaned stayed cleaner than they had in years.

They were fast. Once they learned a task, they performed it with the mechanical precision of scholars who had memorized procedures.

And they were always, always thirsty.

Not drunk - the Captain would never have allowed that on his ship. But they nursed their evening rations of rum like men who had discovered that alcohol could make certain thoughts quieter, certain memories less sharp.

## The Connections

The Boatswain was the first to see it.

"Those two boys," he said to the Captain one evening. "The 'cleaning crew.'"

"What about them?"

"They're educated. Really educated. Heard them talking when they didn't know I was listening. They were discussing philosophy. In Latin."

The Captain nodded. He'd suspected as much.

"The short one was quoting Seneca," the Boatswain continued. "Something about how we suffer more in imagination than in reality."

"Fitting," said the Captain.

"What do you want to do with them?"

The Captain considered. The ship would be in port for another two weeks. After that, a trading run to the Baltic - six weeks at sea, maybe eight depending on weather.

"Introduce them to people," the Captain said finally.

"What people?"

"The right people."

## The Right People

The Boatswain understood. In every port, there are people who need things done. Not illegal things - or not necessarily illegal - but things that require discretion, intelligence, and a certain flexibility regarding rules.

Documents translated. Messages delivered. Introductions made between parties who shouldn't be seen meeting directly.

The kind of work that educated men who asked no questions and left no trail were perfect for.

Within days, the two young men found themselves with additional employment. They still cleaned the ship - the Captain insisted on that, and they were oddly proud of how well they'd learned to do it. But in the evenings, they translated shipping manifests from Danish to Dutch, carried messages between merchants who couldn't afford to meet publicly, and occasionally provided discreet escort for valuable cargo moving between warehouses.

They were good at it. The same sharp intelligence that had made them successful in whatever scholarly pursuit they'd abandoned now made them valuable in the grey economy of port cities.

And they were paid. Not well by noble standards, perhaps, but very well by ship hand standards.

Which they immediately spent on drink.

## The Captain's Observation

The Admiral's wife would have called it enabling. The Captain preferred to think of it as understanding.

These young men weren't drunkards - not yet, anyway. They were escapees. Whatever they were running from pursued them in quiet moments, in sober reflection, in the space between sleep and waking.

The drink didn't solve their problems. But it bought them distance from those problems, a few hours of relief from whatever guilt or shame or fear had driven them to disguise themselves as laborers and seek work on a ship.

The Captain had seen it before. Hell, the Captain had lived it before, though his escape had taken different forms.

They would either face whatever they were running from, or they wouldn't. The Captain couldn't decide that for them. But he could make sure that while they ran, they ran toward something useful rather than just away from something painful.

And so he continued to connect them with people. Merchants who needed translations. Captains who needed discrete intermediaries. Harbor masters who needed someone to verify cargo manifests who could actually read three languages and count accurately after a few drinks.

## The Truth Emerges

It was the shorter one who finally broke.

Six weeks into their employment - three weeks at sea, three back in port - he appeared at the Captain's cabin door late one night. Sober, which was unusual. Anxious, which was not.

"Captain? May I speak with you?"

The Captain gestured him in.

The young man stood there, twisting his hands - hands that were no longer soft, the Captain noted. Six weeks of rope and brush and honest work had left their mark.

"We lied to you," he said. "About who we are."

"I know," said the Captain.

"We're students. Were students. From the university. My friend studied law, I studied medicine."

"And?"

"We... we made a mistake. A serious one. We were drinking - we drank too much, back then, though I suppose we still do - and we got into a fight with some local boys. Nobleman's sons."

The Captain waited.

"One of them was hurt. Badly hurt. He'll recover, but... there was talk of charges. Dueling. Honor courts. Our families could have paid it off, but the shame... we couldn't..."

"So you ran."

"We ran," he confirmed. "Disguised ourselves as workers. Thought we could disappear on a ship, maybe work our way to another country, start over."

"And the drinking?"

The young man laughed bitterly. "Turns out running from your problems doesn't make them go away. It just makes them follow you around while you're somewhere else. The drink helps. A bit. Not much."

The Captain poured two glasses of rum - good rum, from his private stock, not the crew's ration - and handed one to him.

"The Boatswain says you've been quoting Seneca."

"'We suffer more in imagination than in reality,'" he quoted. "Except in our case, we suffered plenty in reality, then ran away and suffered even more in imagination."

"What does your friend say?"

"He wants to keep running. Work our way around the world, never go back. But I..." The young man stared into his rum. "I think we have to face it eventually. You can't run forever. You just get more tired."

## The Captain's Wisdom

The Captain drank his rum slowly before speaking.

"You're right," he said. "You can't run forever. But sometimes you need distance before you can face things clearly. Sometimes you need to become someone different before you can deal with who you were."

"Are we different?"

"Your hands are different," the Captain observed. "Six weeks ago, you couldn't tie a proper knot or scrub a deck without blistering. Now you can do both without thinking. That's not nothing."

"We're still cowards who ran away."

"You're young men who made a mistake, panicked, and ran. Then learned to clean ships, translate documents, carry messages, and be useful. That's not the same as being cowards."

The young man looked up. "What should we do?"

"That's not for me to say," the Captain replied. "But I'll tell you what I've observed: The two of you are smart enough to be valuable, honest enough to be trusted - eventually - and scared enough to work hard. That's a decent combination for building a life, if you can figure out how to use it."

"And the drinking?"

The Captain shrugged. "The drinking is what you do when you don't want to think about things. When you're ready to think about them, you'll drink less. Or maybe you won't. But at least you'll be choosing it, not running from it."

## The Decision

Three days later, the taller one appeared at the same door.

"We're going back," he said without preamble. "Both of us. We're going back to face what we did."

"Your idea or his?"

"His. But he's right. We can't keep running. And..." The young man managed a wry smile, "we're getting too good at being useful here. If we stay much longer, we'll forget we ever wanted to be anything else."

"Being useful isn't the worst thing to be," the Captain observed.

"No, sir. But we were good at other things too. Before. And we owe it to the boy we hurt to stop being cowards about it."

"You have enough money for passage back?"

"Some. We've been saving. Well, he has. I've been drinking mine."

The Captain opened a drawer and pulled out an envelope. "The merchants you've been working for asked me to give you this. Payment for your discretion and efficiency. They said you were the best translators they'd worked with - fast, accurate, and asked no awkward questions."

The young man opened it and stared. "This is..."

"Enough for passage and maybe a lawyer. If you're careful."

## The Departure

The Captain walked them to the dock the day they left.

They looked different than they had six weeks earlier. Harder, in a good way. Browner from sun. More confident in how they moved. Their hands were calloused and their shoulders had broadened from hauling rope and scrubbing decks.

"Thank you, Captain," the shorter one said. "For seeing through our disguise and hiring us anyway."

"For connecting us with people who needed our skills," the taller one added. "We learned a lot."

"You learned to clean," the Captain corrected. "The rest you already knew. You just didn't know it was useful outside a university."

"Will you tell us something, Captain?" the shorter one asked. "Why did you help us? You could have just let us work and fail and go home ashamed."

The Captain looked out at the water, then back at these two young men who had come to him as false workers and were leaving as something more honest.

"Because everyone deserves a chance to run away from their mistakes," he said. "But the smart ones eventually turn around and run toward fixing them instead. I wanted to make sure you had options when you made that turn."

"And if we'd never turned?"

"Then you'd have made excellent ship's cleaners. Tidiest crew compartments I've ever had."

They laughed at that. Then the shorter one sobered.

"One more thing, Captain. The drinking. You never told us to stop, even though you must have seen..."

"I saw two young men using alcohol to quiet thoughts they weren't ready to face. When you became ready, you quieted them a different way - by deciding to act instead of run. The drinking was just a symptom. Treating symptoms rarely fixes problems."

"What fixes problems?" the taller one asked.

"Facing them," the Captain said. "Which you're doing. It won't be easy. The boy you hurt may not forgive you. Your families will be angry. There may be consequences you can't avoid."

"We know."

"But you'll face it as men who learned they can work, can be useful, can be trusted. That counts for something."

They shook hands - workers' handshakes now, firm and honest.

As the Captain watched them board the coach that would take them to the capital, he thought about Seneca's words: _We suffer more in imagination than in reality._

These two had suffered plenty in both. But they'd learned something important during their flight: Sometimes you have to run away from who you were before you can run toward who you need to become.

The drinking would probably continue for a while. Maybe a long while. But it would be different now - not escape, but accompaniment. Not hiding from thoughts, but quieting them enough to face them.

That was progress, of a sort.

The Boatswain appeared beside him.

"Think they'll make it?"

"Make what?" the Captain asked.

"Through whatever they're facing. Back home."

The Captain shrugged. "Maybe. Maybe not. But they'll face it sober enough to learn from it, drunk enough to bear it, and skilled enough to be useful after. That's about the best combination anyone can hope for."

"You going soft in your old age, Captain?"

"Just recognizing that there's more than one way to learn to sail," the Captain replied. "Some people are born to it. Some have it beaten into them. And some clean their way into it while running from something else entirely."

"And the drinking?"

The Captain smiled. "The drinking is what young people with sharp minds and dull futures do to make the present bearable. When their futures get sharper, the present needs less bearing."

"That philosophy or experience talking?"

"Yes," said the Captain.

_The Black Captain never learned what became of the two young scholars. But six months later, a letter arrived at the port master's office, addressed to "The Captain of the Ship with the Tidiest Compartments." Inside was a bank note for passage they never used, a note that said only "We faced it. Thank you." - and a bottle of very good rum._

_The Captain shared the rum with the Boatswain._

_The money he gave to the next pair of young fools who showed up pretending to be something they weren't._
