# The Voyage to Greece - Part II: The Vanishing Shore

*This is Part II of the Greek Voyage. [Read Part I: The Silent Passenger](/posts/2025-12-03-voyage-to-greece.html)*

---

The silent passenger walked into the city and did not look back.

The crew watched until his dark figure disappeared among the crowds of [Thessaloniki](/treasure-trove/thessaloniki.html) - that ancient port where Alexander's sister had given her name, where Paul had preached to Europe, where Demetrios still streamed his fragrant myrrh in the church that bore his name.

The strange benefactor was gone. The gold had been distributed among the crew. The voyage was paid in full.

And yet something lingered - a weight in the air, a silence that persisted even as the port awakened around them with the clatter of commerce and the cries of seabirds.

## The Port of Alexander's Heirs

The crew stood at the rail, taking in the city for the first time without the presence of their uncanny passenger.

[Thessaloniki](/treasure-trove/thessaloniki.html) sprawled before them - layer upon layer of history made stone. Roman arches crumbled beside Byzantine domes. Ottoman minarets pierced the sky next to modern apartment blocks. The waterfront stretched for kilometers, a promenade where the ancient and contemporary walked side by side.

"This is the city of the Macedonians," the Greek said, his voice carrying a note of pride that transcended his Cretan origins. "From here, Alexander's generals set forth to rule the world. The [phalangites](/treasure-trove/thessaloniki.html) marched down these roads. The Companion Cavalry watered their horses at springs that still flow."

The Boatswain spat over the rail. "Old stones and dead kings. I've seen ports in every sea. They're all the same - men selling fish, women selling everything else, and priests selling salvation."

"This one is different," [the Russian](/pages/ships-crew.html#the-russian) said quietly. His bald head gleamed in the grey December light, the scars of hard winters visible even from a distance. "I can feel it. There is holiness here. Old holiness. Deep as the sea."

The crew exchanged glances. The Russian was not a man given to poetry. When he spoke of fighting bears or saving grandmothers from wolves, he spoke with the matter-of-fact tone of a man describing breakfast. But now his voice held something else - a hunger, perhaps, or a recognition.

"Go, then," the Captain said. "We anchor here for two days before we move to other ports. Explore. Pray, if prayer calls you. Drink, if wine calls instead. Meet back aboard by sunset tomorrow."

## The Dispersal

The crew scattered into the city like seeds from a dandelion.

Some headed for the waterfront tavernas, drawn by the scent of grilled octopus and the promise of *retsina* - that strange Greek wine that tasted of pine resin, an acquired pleasure that most northerners never acquired.

Others sought the markets, where vendors hawked olives in a hundred varieties, cheeses aging in brine, honey from the slopes of Mount Olympus, and icons painted by monks whose brushes had never painted anything secular.

The Greek led a small contingent to the Church of Hagios Demetrios, promising to show them the crypt where the saint had been martyred, the silver reliquary that held his bones, the spot where myrrh still seeped from the stones on holy days.

But the Russian went alone.

The Captain watched him walk into the city with the deliberate pace of a man on pilgrimage - not wandering, not exploring, but *seeking*. He did not ask directions. He did not consult a map. He walked as if he could sense the churches of Thessaloniki pulling at him like magnets pulling iron filings.

"He'll find trouble," the Navigator said, appearing at the Captain's elbow with her characteristic silent approach. "Or trouble will find him."

"Perhaps," the Captain replied. "But it's not our trouble to prevent. A man must answer his own callings."

## The Heavy Water

By evening, most of the crew had gathered at a taverna near the [Rotunda](/treasure-trove/rotunda.html) - that great cylindrical building that had been Roman tomb, Byzantine church, and Ottoman mosque across seventeen centuries of turbulent history.

The establishment was small and smoky, its walls decorated with faded photographs of ships and sailors, its tables scarred by generations of elbows and knives. The owner - a massive man with a mustache that seemed to have its own personality - served plates of meze without being asked and filled glasses with something he called "special water."

"*Tsipouro*," the Greek explained, raising his glass. "Not raki - that's the Cretan drink. This is Macedonian. Made from the grape skins after the wine is pressed. Very strong. Very pure."

The crew drank. The liquid was clear as water but burned like fire - a deceptive combination that had toppled many a sailor who trusted his eyes over his throat.

"Greek heavy water," the Boatswain said, wiping his lips. "I've heard of this. They say it makes men see things that aren't there."

"Or things that are there," the Greek replied, "but that sober eyes cannot perceive."

It was then that they saw the Russian.

## Circles in the Dark

He was walking in circles.

Not wandering aimlessly - that the crew might have understood, especially after a day in an unfamiliar city and an evening with the heavy water. But these were deliberate circles, traced around the massive bulk of the Rotunda as if he were performing some ancient ritual.

"What in God's name is he doing?" the Chief Mate asked.

The Greek set down his glass. "Praying. The Orthodox walk around holy sites clockwise - it's called *peripatesis*, the circling walk. Some pilgrims circle churches three times. Some circle seven. Some circle until they can no longer stand."

"He's been at it for an hour," one of the younger sailors said. "I saw him when we arrived. He's made dozens of circuits."

The Captain rose from the table and walked to the doorway. From there, he could see the Russian clearly in the lamplight - a bald, scarred figure moving with mechanical precision around the ancient building. His lips were moving, but no sound reached across the distance.

"Should we stop him?" the Navigator asked.

"From praying? In a city full of churches? I think not." The Captain returned to his seat. "Let him circle until he finds what he's seeking - or until he's too tired to seek any longer."

They returned to their drinking, but the mood had shifted. Something about the Russian's relentless circling unsettled them in ways they couldn't articulate. The heavy water, which had seemed festive, now felt vaguely ominous.

When the taverna closed at midnight, the Russian was still circling.

## The Navigator's Report

The Captain did not sleep well that night. Whether it was the heavy water, the strange city, or the memory of their passenger's words about visions beyond the veil, he tossed in his narrow cabin like a ship in confused seas.

He rose before dawn and found the Navigator already awake, standing at the rail with a mug of something steaming.

"The Russian returned," she said without preamble. Her voice carried the precise cadence of someone delivering a report. "Three hours past midnight. I was on watch."

"Drunk?"

"That's the strange thing." The Navigator turned to face him. Her sharp eyes - eyes that missed nothing, that saw paths where others saw only obstacles - held an unusual uncertainty. "He wasn't drunk at all. No stumbling. No slurring. No smell of alcohol on his breath. He walked aboard straight as a mast and went directly to his berth."

"Perhaps he found religion instead of drink."

"Perhaps." The Navigator paused. "But Captain - his eyes. When he passed me, I saw his eyes in the lantern light. They were... I don't know how to describe it. Empty. Not vacant like a drunk man's, but empty like a church after the congregation has left. As if whatever usually occupied them had stepped out for a moment."

The Captain considered this. "What do you think he saw out there?"

"I don't know. But I think he saw something. And I don't think he wanted to see it."

## Departure

The ship departed Thessaloniki at midday, sliding out of the harbor into the grey Aegean. The crew moved with the efficient silence of men nursing headaches and unanswered questions. The Russian stood at the rail, watching the city recede, his face expressionless.

"We sail for other ports," the Captain announced. "The Cyclades, perhaps. Or Crete, if the wind favors us. Our hold is empty, but our voyage is paid. We sail where curiosity takes us."

The Greek's eyes lit up at the mention of Crete. Home, for a Cretan, is never far from thought - especially when the alternative is northern waters.

The ship found its rhythm. The coast of Macedonia gave way to the coast of Thessaly. Mountains rose and fell in the distance. Small islands dotted the sea like punctuation marks in an endless sentence.

By evening, they had cleared the northern Aegean. The sun set behind them, painting the sky in shades of orange and crimson that no northern sunset could match. The crew gathered for dinner, their spirits rising with the wind.

It was after dinner, as the stars emerged in their multitudes, that the Captain took his place at the helm.

## The Vanishing

The Captain was not a superstitious man. He had sailed every sea, weathered every storm, seen every trick that water and sky could play on human perception. He knew about mirages, about atmospheric refraction, about the ways that light and distance could conspire to deceive the eye.

He knew all of this. And yet.

He looked aft, toward the coast they had left behind, and saw nothing.

Not darkness - darkness he could have understood. Not fog - there was no fog, the night was crystalline clear. But the coast of Greece, which should have been visible as a darker line against the dark sky, studded with the lights of coastal villages and the glow of distant cities...

It was simply not there.

The Captain blinked. He rubbed his eyes. He looked again.

The sea stretched behind them, flat and featureless, as if they sailed not from a coast but from the edge of the world itself. As if Greece had never existed - or had ceased to exist the moment they left it.

"Navigator," he called, keeping his voice steady.

She appeared beside him with her characteristic silent approach. "Captain?"

"Look aft. Tell me what you see."

She looked. She looked for a long moment. When she turned back, her face held the same careful blankness it had held when describing the Russian's empty eyes.

"I see the sea," she said. "Only the sea."

"And the coast?"

"There is no coast. There is nothing."

They stood in silence. Behind them, the dark mirror of the Aegean reflected nothing but stars.

"The heavy water," the Captain said finally. "Perhaps it lingers in the system."

"I drank none of it," the Navigator replied. "You know I don't drink."

Another silence.

"Perhaps it's a trick of the atmosphere," the Captain offered. "Inversion layers. Cold air over warm water. These things happen in southern seas."

"Perhaps," the Navigator agreed, in a tone that agreed with nothing.

They stood at the helm until the small hours, watching the place where Greece should have been, seeing only absence.

By morning, the coast was visible again - a thin line on the horizon, ordinary and unremarkable. The crew went about their duties without noticing anything amiss. The Navigator said nothing, and the Captain said nothing, and the Russian continued to stare eastward with eyes that seemed to be looking at something beyond the visible world.

But the Captain, alone with his thoughts in the grey light of dawn, could not shake the memory of that moment when he had looked behind him and found nothing at all.

Was it the heavy water, playing tricks with his perception?

Was it a natural phenomenon, explicable by the cold equations of atmospheric physics?

Or was it something else - a premonition, perhaps, of the way all things vanish eventually? The way civilizations rise and fall, the way passengers walk into cities and disappear, the way even the solid earth can become, in the right light, as insubstantial as a dream?

The Captain did not know. And as the ship sailed on toward warmer waters, he found that he did not particularly want to know.

Some mysteries are meant to be carried, not solved. Some questions are meant to be asked, not answered.

And some coasts, once left behind, are never quite as solid as they seemed.

*The Captain's reflection: The Greek philosophers spoke of the veil between appearance and reality - the way the world we see is merely shadows cast by a fire we cannot perceive directly. The Silent Passenger had seen beyond that veil and lost his taste for ordinary life. The Russian, circling the Rotunda in the dark, perhaps glimpsed something that made his eyes go empty. And the Captain, standing at the helm in the small hours, saw a coast vanish as if it had never been.*

*What does it mean? The Captain does not pretend to know. But he has learned this: the sea is not only water, and the shore is not only stone. There are depths beneath depths, and shores beyond shores, and sometimes the veil thins enough to let us see - or fail to see - what lies beneath the surface of things.*

*The voyage continues. The questions remain. And somewhere on Mount Athos, a man who once paid in gold is learning to pray in silence.*
