The Black Captain, in all his travels across the digital waters, has encountered many ports worth visiting. These are the harbors where wisdom dwells, where words carry weight, and where the soul finds nourishment that no rum can provide.

## Recommended Harbors

### [Szeptam - w waszych snach...](https://szeptam.wordpress.com/)

**The Captain's words**: The Captain's most beloved cousin whispers dark philosophical truths into the void - tales that question the nature of guilt, dialogues with divinity over coffee, and surreal journeys through moral labyrinths where complicity and redemption dance their eternal waltz; a Polish storyteller who has been crafting these haunting narratives since 2004, accumulating sixty voyages into the depths of human consciousness, each one a mirror held up to the parts of ourselves we pretend don't exist.

**What awaits there**: A collection of dark fiction and philosophical dialogues in Polish, spanning nearly two decades of creative exploration. From psychological horror examining moral complicity ("Wina") to intimate conversations with God about free will and determinism ("U boga na kawie"), these stories probe existential questions with unflinching honesty. The author's distinctive voice blends surreal imagery with contemplative prose, creating narratives that disturb and enlighten in equal measure.

**Language**: Polish (Polski)

**Active since**: 2004
