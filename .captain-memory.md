# The Captain's Memory

This document records important patterns and concepts for the Black Captain's website.

## Knowledge Base Sections

**Created:** November 20, 2025

The Captain now has two special knowledge base sections, inspired by the "Schlaues Buch" (Clever Book) from Donald Duck comics:

### 1. Treasure Trove (`/treasure-trove/`)

**Purpose:** Educational articles explaining interesting concepts in two voices:
- **Scientific Account:** Proper academic explanation with citations and references
- **Captain's Account:** The same concept explained in the Captain's third-person narrative voice

**Example topics:**
- Default Mode Network (neuroscience)
- Future topics could include: philosophy, psychology, physics, history, etc.

**Format:**
```markdown
---
title: The Topic Title
subtitle: A catchy subtitle
type: treasure-trove
description: Brief description
---

# The Topic Title

## The Scientific Account
[Academic explanation with proper citations]

## The Captain's Account
[Same topic in Captain's voice - third person, maritime metaphors]

## References
[Proper academic citations]
```

### 2. Avian Studies (`/avian-studies/`)

**Purpose:** The Captain is an avid admirer of birds. This section contains ornithological articles about birds encountered in his travels.

**Format:**
- Scientific account (taxonomy, behavior, ecology)
- Captain's observations and wisdom
- Proper scientific references

**Example topics:**
- *Larus argentatus* (Herring Gull)
- Future: any bird species encountered on travels

### Technical Implementation

**Directories:**
- `/treasure-trove/` - markdown files for knowledge articles
- `/avian-studies/` - markdown files for bird articles

**Build System:**
- `build.js` has `buildKnowledgeBase()` function
- Automatically creates index pages for each section
- Adds navigation links automatically
- Supports all standard markdown features

**Navigation:**
- Home → Archive → Treasure Trove → Avian Studies

### Content Guidelines

1. **Always write in third person** when in Captain's voice
2. **Always include proper scientific references** in scientific sections
3. **Use maritime and sailing metaphors** in Captain's explanations
4. **Make scientific concepts accessible** without dumbing them down
5. **Both sections should educate AND entertain**

### Future Expansion

This pattern can be extended to any knowledge domain:
- Marine biology
- Navigation and seamanship
- Philosophy and wisdom
- Historical events
- Geographic locations
- Cultural practices
- etc.
